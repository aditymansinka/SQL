## Bookstore Database Project

The Bookstore Database Project is a relational database for managing and analyzing bookstore operations using SQL. It consists of three main tables: Books (storing details like title, author, genre, price, and stock), Customers (with name, email, city, and country), and Orders (recording purchases with customer, book, date, and quantity). Through SQL queries, users can extract insights such as best-selling books, most active customers, revenue by genre, out-of-stock books, and order trends by country. This project presents an efficient approach for using SQL for data analysis in the real world.
